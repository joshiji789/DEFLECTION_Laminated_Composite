•	Construction of practical Machine Learning (ML) based model for the prediction of the deflection of the laminated composite rectangular plate. Results shows the method is inexpensive and accurate. <br/>
•	Three ML models are used to predict the deflection, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network Model (NN) and Gaussian Process regression (GP). <br/>
•	The coefficients of determination (R2) for SVM, NN and GP models are each 0.77, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively, according to the results.<br/>
